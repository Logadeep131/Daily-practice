raise salary will increase all the salary of particular destination
proide option for create destination

display should display all the employee data

main method is to be design like client side

class doesn't contain dsa declared in it
ex employee has no employee list

Emp emp[] = new Emp[100] it just hold the space not occupy the memory

object only alocate memory

---------------------------------------------------------
interface in java

abstract can be with or without abstract method in it

abstract class a{
public abstract void abc()
}
interface class a{
public abstract void abc()
}

similary like abstract class interface method should compelsary define in class which implements

interface variables are static in default public|static|final (const)

interface provide the rule for the implementation ****
interface is not like inheritance 

interface can extends multiple interfaces but class cant

example interface extends interface is the multiple inheritance

in which method dont have the body it simply define this method is to implement with body in class 

byte || executable code can be decomiled back so it can be hackable 
interface is used in that place

interface provide the abstraction
interface is to interact by user

--code for interface--
1.abstraction
2.security
3.java.sql.Connection is interface
java.sql.ResultSet|Statement|Connection
api used in jdbc is interface

depends on driver we can connect database

compulsarly define value for the variable because it public static final

public abstract is default method for interface and no body{}****

interface extends multiple interface it inherit the parent interface provide resusability 

without implementing the interface can able to access the variable since it is        public

interface dont have constructor it just have a methods();

----------------------------------
constructor vs method

constructor and method are both similar
one and only difference is method is called multipe times but constructor is called only once [that should be invoke only once]

------------------------------
abstract class vs interface

interface is faster/memory space is less occupied 

Marker interface{}
it just marking something  
rmi remote interface 

functional interface
one and only abstract method compulsorly implemented
ex runnable.comparable

 --marker  
interface i{
}
--functional interface
 interface j{
public void abc();
}
--general/normal interface
interface k
{
public void abc();
public void atob();	
}

Access Modifier
public 
private
protected
default 

public class can be accessed by all the class in same or different package

class can have only public or default
access specifier

no private or protected info for class


default provide the class to accessible by the class in the same package (default package protected)

****public by all the packages
****default by same package only

protected variable access by all the class in same package and as well extend by some other class in different package

defult variable acces by all the class in same package

public a b c d e f
private a
protected a b c e f
int abc //default is accessed by the same package only
