-----execption handling ------------


if everything fine in compilation but still some error is called as runtime error

compile == syntactical error

------runtime error-------
runtime == logical error

logical error is of 2 types
1.error
2.exception

error cannot be handled
exception can be handled

exception can be classified into two types 1.compile time exception/checked this is checked in the compile time 
2.runtime exception/unchecked this is checked at the runtime 


exception are come only under the runtime error

if any syntax error it will not compile the code that is compile time error are syntax error

runtime -> error -> exception

in order to avoid the termination we use exception 

----------try------------
is the place that exception may be raised

--------catch-------
1.one catch can only catch one exception
2.any order is fine for catching if the multiple catch block is there means

generall catch(Exception e) handle all the causes

catch( NullPointerExceptino | ArithmeticException |) | is used to and in sigle catch block with multiple exception 


-------finally ------
system.exit() is terminate the program,in this only case finally is not executed remaining all the case finally will work

catch block not handle but finaly is after that means

then finally will print and then the catch will terminate the program





----------throw-------

****try catch is used for checked exception ****
unchecked exception is not mandatory to write in try catch 




-------throws--------

this is the method i m not going to handle,i pass to who calling it.

*****class extends RuntimeException class then it unchecked class

*****if class extends Exception class then it is checked class

javap java.lang.NullPointerException 

---------throws---------

rmi remote exception 

unreported exception occur for checked exception
ex IOException and SQLExecption 

public normaly try catch is used handle the exception must defined for the checked exception

throw are used to pass the exception to the method that should handle this

 jvm starts the main method so jvm has default handler 
print the stack -> name the error -> terminate the program

throws is re-throw the exception 

good practice to handle the exception with try catch block

unchecked exception are automatically passed need to mention the name in the throws...|| you can also mention it for the reading purose.

if i have handler try and catch in main method 

with throws key word i can throw it to the caller in which only the checked exception is to mention.

try should definetly come with catch || finally

in between any statement is not allowed try catch finally

subclass to the super class exception order to be maintained
