ry with round bracket try() automatically it close the resource open inside the try block.
no need to declare finally() and close separately

if in this case like 
A Aobj=null;
try{
Aobj = new A()
}
it will create heap memory when multiple object is created means memory out of space

try() only auto closable clas can pass to the try with round bracket

if class implements readable and closable then it can 
be send to the try();

custom made class which implements the AutoClosable and the close method to be defined();
so try() can be used for creating src and can close automatically

a created 
b created
release is in reverse order first b then a is released

*******even if exception it will release the allocation

resource programming is to write with try( res alloc ){}
finally and try() realloc is only not done in the System.exit();

try must follow with catch and finally
try with resource try() no need catch and finally;
