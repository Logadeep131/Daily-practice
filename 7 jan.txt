noun for class
verb for method
entity for variable

is-A relationship means inheritance
has-A means association/composition

oops is a concept

ordbms some of the concepts

encapsulation hiding the data using private scope 
methods - public
variable - private

pure encapsulated class is all the variable is private and methods are public


abstraction hiding the methodology/implementation

polymorphism compile time (overloading), run time(overriding)

overriding is have the same name and same parameters 

superclass variable can create obj of subclass viseversa is not possible

new a() //parent it will call its own constructor.
new b() will call its constructor as will as parent class constructor

static methods cant be overridden
when both super and subclass is static method means

abstract class can constructor it is called by the subclass constructor

display the name and how much to increase decided by manager and displayed back

* class name start with capital letter
* method name start with small letter
* if more than one word then every next words first letter should be in cap
* package names must be all in small letters no separation
* constant names must all be in caps if more than one word then separated by underscore_.

jre byte code to machine code

path where .class file exist classpath 
path where executable file is exist path

data types

constant
variables

primitive :
	Numeric :
		whole: byte(1),short,int,long(4)
		real : float(4),double(8)
	non numeric
		char(2) ascii,unicode java follows this one 
		Boolean(1)
non primitive
	array class interface Enum

integer in which there is no short int and long int it is simply short
no unsigned keyword in java

float + int works (5 + a) a =3.142
float a= (float) 3.142 || 3.142f || 3.142F

similarly for mention long a= 1234568798l || L this should be mention as suffix

if(-1 || 1 || 0) not work it gives error

const no keywords instead of that use final

>> divide by 2
>>> is used to convert the + to - and - to + of the number >>> one left shift + changing the lsb
<< multiple by 2

class name and file name should be same when public class
if i don't have public scope then it get compiled

multiple class name with multiple main method is possible

with main method just start the execution of program
multiple main method provide option for start the program

single java has multiple main method and single class can call multiple main method 

javap for reading the class file. compiler provide the default constructor for a class {every constructor call super class constructor provide by compiler}

if no value for the variable
data type default statement
num = 0 
bool = false 
char = blank

new gives intial memory

constructor gives the value for the variable

this refer the current object 
this is to distinguish between class variable and obj variable

one constructor can call another constructor

in which the constructor call must be as the first statement inside the constructor 

object refer variable or object new provide memory address and its pointed by  object;

r1 object reference variable holding the address

//r1 and r2 both are objects
r1 = r2
r1 now point to the r2 objects value
holding the address created by new

Array of objects

Person person[] = new Person[5];
for(int i=0;i<person.length;i++)
{
	person[i] = new Person();
	person[i].name = user[i]
}

array to create // arrays are object in java
----------------
int arr[] = new int[10]; 10integer value are stored

rows are mandatory in java even column value not provided its compile.

***jagged array---every row with different column

single dimensional array combine with other 1d array to provide multidimensional array
