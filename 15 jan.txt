immutable class

object can be created once and it cant modify its variable or object not get modified

final key word is used to not create inheritance

this is used for provide more security for the object

*******serializable is to convert to form the netword*****

cloneable -- keyword
cloneable is to override but cant able to copy

hashcode is to create hash for the object

// s1=object of some class means s1.hashcode()=provide the hashcode for the s1 object.

equals method return true for false s1.equals(S2)
this will check whether both the objects are same or not

----condition----

variable are final
and class is also final
serilizable to create network
must implement few functions this and also in default it contains some method can be able to override

java.lang.Record document is used to see the 
hascode equals toString three method 

****record Student(int roll,String name) -> this is the constructor there is no default constructor we have to mention constructor parameter or we have to declare default constructor inside the record class

 		**********

record Student()
{
	static String SchoolName;
	Student()
	{
		SchoolName="ABC"
	}
	Student(int rollno,String name,int standard)
	{
		this(); it will call the above constructor because we may have empty constructor.
	}
}

record Student(int rollno,String name,int standard) this is canonical constructor

final cant inherit

some class can extend and some cant extend for this keyword is used is **sealed**

sealed class Manager permits SalesManager

1.permit keyword give permission to the subclass that can only inherit the super sealed class
2.And the subclass is to be in final that should not be inherit by any other class


-------short summary of first half 15 jan---------
1.immutable class
toString() hascode() equals()
variable are final and class is final class

2.records is canonical constructor
ex record student(int a,String abc,int b) this is the immutable class provide int java 17 it default contain all the above method for immutable class

3.cant inherit
final class cant inherit 
in case of only few case can access means sealed and permits are used

normal class cant extend the sealed class
non-sealed is to give as keyword it act similary like normal class why we provie is sealed class provide the permission to extend either we have to use
1.final
2.sealed
3.non-sealed


------2nd half---------

variables in java
var is used in java version 10

var a=5
System.out.println(a)
var a="hi"
System.out.println(a)
float var=3.245f this is possible var can be declared as variable
class var is not allowed // var is only allowed as local variable 
var <- is not used as global datatype 

int arr[] = new int[10];
var arr= new int[5];

------switch case------
switch(//int and string are only allowed inside the switch case )

Enum can be allowed in switch case
Enum Month
{
	JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,MAY....
}

case JAN,FEB,MAR :
case APR,MAY,JUN :
case JUL,AUG,SEP :

case -> this will automatically break when terminate

case -> {//multiple statement you can put into body }

case -> "Summer" this will simply return the string 

String weater = switch(Month.FEB)
switch -> int,char,string,enum, and return statement
